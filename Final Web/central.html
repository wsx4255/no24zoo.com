The southern part of Lalu Island is shaped like a new moon, and the northern part is shaped like a sun; hence the name Sun Moon Lake.</p>
                  <p>The most famous sights around Sun Moon Lake are the Itashao, Lalu Island, the Xuanzang Temple, the Ci-en Pagoda, and the Wenwu Temple and so on. The natural forests bordering these roads are good places for bird watching. There are a lot of birds that live on the mid-elevation, such as the Grey-cheeked Fulvetta, Grap-throated Minivet, Formosan Yuhina, Gray Tree Pie, Bamboo Partridge, Chinese Bulbul, Muller's Barbet, and the Black Bulbul.</p>
                  <p>Colonies of Black-crowned Night herons and Egretta garzettas , and birds such as the common kingfisher and the Green-winged Teal can be seen at the Dazhuhu water reservation, situated around the water gate.

                  <p class="card-text">Taiwan's mountains are attracting the attention of hikers from all over the world for their height, which rivals the Alps and the Rocky Mountains, and their beautiful alpine scenery. While some of the highest peaks require considerable time and effort to reach, there is one place on the island that gives an instant overview of what Taiwan's mountains have to offer. Mt. Hehuan, despite its altitude of more than 3,000 meters, has a road that goes right across it, making access very convenient. It is the best place to see snow in the tropics, and escape from the summer heat. In as little as one day, you can travel the highest road in East Asia, and take the many hiking paths that lead off the main road. These are usually short and always safe.</p>
                  <p>Mt. Hehuan, Taiwan's "tourist mountain," rivals the island's other high peaks in scenery and atmosphere, yet it is easily reachable by car or on foot. Accommodation is offered at Hohuan Cottage. At the same time, it is the starting point for one of Taiwan's most challenging and exciting treks, Chilai Ridge, a two-day "ultimate experience" that involves negotiating a knife-edge ridge with many dizzying pinnacles. Although the road scares away many of the birds and animals for which Taiwan is known, a short walk along the trails leading off the main road, particularly those in the direction of Chilai, will reveal their presence."</p>

                  <p class="card-text">For those interested in high mountain farm life there are several farms in these mountainous regions that welcome visitors and offer an insight in local rural life. One of the most prominent farms, which can be easily reached from Mt. Hehuan, is Wuling Farm, located about 29 kilometers from Lishan on the Yilan branch of the Central Cross-Island Highway. This farm was established in 1963 to provide employment for retired servicemen. On the more than 700 hectares of land, at an altitude of 1,740-2,100 meters, high-mountain fruits (pears, peaches, apples, etc.) and vegetables (cabbage, spinach, etc.) as well as tea (Qingxin Oolong) are grown. </p>
                  <p>The spectacular scenery of the surrounding mountains, with nice walks to scenic spots like the 50-meter Taoshan Waterfall, creates an oasis of tranquillity. It is hard to tell the best time to visit Wuling Farm, as nearly all year round you will be delighted either by blossoming fruit orchards (spring and early summer ) or the abundance of harvest (summer and autumn). Formosan Salmon, also known as the "Cherry Blossom Hook Salmon", which is unusual in this part of the world, is a very rare variety of fish on the verge of extinction. Wuling Farm is the home of this land-locked salmon and you can find it in the Qijiawan Creek Ecological Protection Area.</p>
